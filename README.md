## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Git (for cloning the repository)
- 8GB RAM
- 50GB Storage
---

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Hamada-khairi/Hamada-FYP.git
   cd Hamada-FYP
   ```

2. Set up the environment variables:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Edit the `.env` file with your desired configurations.

3. Increase the max map count (required for Wazuh):
   ```
   sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
   ```

4. Generate certificates for the Wazuh indexer:
   ```
   docker-compose -f generate-indexer-certs.yml run --rm generator
   ```
   
5. Generate wild card certificates for Traefik you can change the Domain
   ```
    openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
        -keyout ./traefik/config/certs/cert-key.pem \
        -out ./traefik/config/certs/cert.pem \
        -subj "/CN=*.hamada.local" \
        -addext "subjectAltName=DNS:*.hamada.local,DNS:hamada.local" 
   ```

6. Verifying the Certs:
   ```
    openssl x509 -outform der -in ./traefik/config/certs/cert.pem -out ./traefik/config/certs/cert.der
   
    openssl x509 -in ./traefik/config/certs/cert.pem -text -noout
   
    openssl rsa -noout -modulus -in ./traefik/config/certs/cert-key.pem | openssl md5
   
    openssl x509 -noout -modulus -in ./traefik/config/certs/cert.pem | openssl md5 
   ```

7. Configuring The Dns:
   ```
   nano bind9/config/hamada.local.zone
   ```
   add your Privet IP here

8. Configuring The telegraf:
   ```
   sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock
   ```

9. Start the services:
   ```
   docker-compose up -d
   ```


 10. if you are on ubuntu do this:
      ```
      sudo nano /etc/systemd/resolved.conf
      ```
   
      ```
      uncomment both DNSStubListener=no and put your privet ip here DNS=10.0.0.134 
      ```

   ```
       sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved
   ```
   
   
 11. Access the services through their respective URLs (as defined in your Traefik configuration).


---

If you Dont want to use BIND9 DNS you can add these to your /etc/hosts

   ```
   nano /etc/hosts
   ```

And paste these 

   ```
   127.0.0.1 traefik-dashboard.hamada.local
   127.0.0.1 wazuh-manager.hamada.local
   127.0.0.1 wazuh-indexer.hamada.local
   127.0.0.1 wazuh-dashboard.hamada.local
   127.0.0.1 telegraf.hamada.local
   127.0.0.1 influx.hamada.local
   127.0.0.1 grafana.hamada.local
   127.0.0.1 filebrowser.hamada.local
   127.0.0.1 it-tools.hamada.local
   127.0.0.1 dashboard.hamada.local
   127.0.0.1 port.hamada.local
   ```

## Configuration

### Traefik

Traefik is configured to handle routing and SSL termination for all services. The configuration can be found in `traefik/config/traefik.yaml`.

### Wazuh

Wazuh configuration files are located in the `wazuh/config/` directory. You may need to adjust these based on your specific security requirements.

### Telegraf, InfluxDB, and Grafana

These services work together to provide monitoring and visualization capabilities. Telegraf configuration can be found in `telegraf/telegraf.conf`.

### Other Services

Configurations for other services can be found in their respective directories or within the `docker-compose.yml` file.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the logs of the specific service:
   ```
   docker-compose logs [service_name]
   ```
2. Ensure all required ports are open and not in use by other services.
3. Verify that all environment variables in the `.env` file are correctly set.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please feel free to submit a Pull Request.

## Security Features

This project incorporates several security measures to protect your infrastructure and data:

1. **Wazuh Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**
   - Wazuh provides comprehensive security monitoring and threat detection.
   - It offers real-time analysis of security events across your infrastructure.
   - Features include log analysis, file integrity monitoring, vulnerability detection, and compliance monitoring.

2. **Traefik as a Reverse Proxy with SSL/TLS Encryption**
   - Traefik acts as a secure gateway to your services, managing routing and load balancing.
   - It automatically handles SSL/TLS certificate management for HTTPS connections.
   - This ensures encrypted communication between clients and your services, protecting data in transit.

3. **Network Segmentation with Docker Networks**
   - The project uses a custom Docker network (`hamada-network`) to isolate containers.
   - This network segmentation limits the attack surface and contains potential security breaches.
   - It allows for fine-grained control over inter-container communication.

### Additional Security 

- **Bind9 DNS Server**: Provides a local DNS resolution, reducing reliance on external DNS services and potential DNS-based attacks.
